Each database requires at least one database administrator (DBA). An Oracle Database system can be large and can have many users. Therefore, database administration is sometimes not a one-person job, but a job for a group of DBAs who share responsibility.

A database administrator's responsibilities can include the following tasks:

Installing and upgrading the Oracle Database server and application tools

Allocating system storage and planning future storage requirements for the database system

Creating primary database storage structures (tablespaces) after application developers have designed an application

Creating primary objects (tables, views, indexes) once application developers have designed an application

Modifying the database structure, as necessary, from information given by application developers

Enrolling users and maintaining system security

Ensuring compliance with Oracle license agreements

Controlling and monitoring user access to the database

Monitoring and optimizing the performance of the database

Planning for backup and recovery of database information

Maintaining archived data on tape

Backing up and restoring the database

Contacting Oracle for technical supportDatabase Administrators
